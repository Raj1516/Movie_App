As per the requirements of the project , I have completed the requirements of the project. These are stored in a folder called 'backend' and the frontend of the project is stored in the folder called frontend.

I have mentioned the steps to deploy the code below

step1: Before running the project, we will need to install the project dependencies so.

step2: go to the 'frontend' folder from command line and run the 'npm install' command

step3: then go to the 'backend' folder  from command line  and run the 'npm install' command there as well

Now , after dependency installation the project is ready to be deployed

step4: go to 'backend' folder from the command line terminal and run either of two commands - 'npm run dev' or 'node server.js'

The server.js is the index file of the backend where server initializaton using express is done 

Mongo db connection will be established as soon as the server get started

step5: navigate to the 'frontend' folder using the command line and then run 'npm start' command, this will spin up the react app

Now, the peoject will be deployed and ready to use

frontend URL: http://localhost/3000
backend URL : http://localhost/8085

I am facing a little error while working with coupons nad fetching them, it was a little confusing for me. However I have tried my best and made sure that all other features are working well

Thanks....!
